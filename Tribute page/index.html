                <p>Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela born Rolihlahla Mandela was a politician, diplomat, and anti-apartheid campaigner from South Africa who presided over the country as its first president from 1994 to 1999.
                     He was the first elected head of state to be elected in a completely representative democratic election in the history of the nation. His government's main goal was to promote racial harmony in order to undermine the legacy of apartheid.
                     He presided over the African National Congress (ANC) party from 1991 to 1997 and was an ideological socialist and African nationalist.
